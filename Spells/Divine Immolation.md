Divine flames scour creatures within the area. Creatures take 6d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent,fire damage. The divine power within the flames scorches the spirit as well; a creature takes spirit damage instead of fire damage from divine immolation if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM).
