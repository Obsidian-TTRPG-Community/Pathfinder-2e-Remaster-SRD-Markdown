# Ring of Truth
![[icons-magic-symbols-star-inverted-yellow.webp|150]]

You designate an area in which lies are revealed. Creatures in the area also take a –2 status penalty to Deception checks. Each time a creature in the area speaks a true statement, the soft ring of a bell sounds in the area. Creatures are aware of the magic; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. If a creature is in the area when the spell is cast or later enters the area, that creature attempts a Will save. It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is so convincing that the bell rings even if they lie.

**Success** If the target lies and succeeds at their Deception check against all targets, the bell still rings.

**Failure** The bell accurately sees through their deception and will never ring if they lie
