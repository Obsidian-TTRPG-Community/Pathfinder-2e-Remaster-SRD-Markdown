# Repulsion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-repulsion.webp|150]]

You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you Cast the Spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of _repulsion_. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature's movement is not restricted.

**Success** The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.

**Failure** The creature can't move closer to you within the area.
