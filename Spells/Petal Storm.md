# Petal Storm
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-hand-green.webp|150]]

You bring forth a cloud of razor-sharp flower petals that thrash violently in the wind. A creature that enters the storm or starts its turn in the storm is sliced by the razor-sharp edges of the petals. It takes 2d10 slashing damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from the petals only once per round. At the end of the duration, the storm calms and the petals fall harmlessly to the ground.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d10.
