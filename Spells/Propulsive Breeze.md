# Propulsive Breeze
![[icons-magic-air-wind-tornado-spiral-blue-gray.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally in range Strides or Leaps.

* * *

You create a current of wind at your ally's back, propelling their movement. When your ally's Stride or [[Leap]] ends, the current propels them an additional 15 feet in the same direction as the last 5 feet of their Stride or Leap.
