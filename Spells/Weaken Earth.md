# Weaken Earth
![[icons-commodities-stone-clay-grey.webp|150]]

You weaken the bonds that hold earth and stone together. If your target has Hardness, you can affect one contiguous object, up to a 5-foot cube, or one creature, decreasing the Hardness by 5, to a minimum of 0. If the target lacks Hardness, it gains weakness 3 to physical damage. A target with a Fortitude modifier can attempt a Fortitude saving throw, negating the effect on a success.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Hardness decreases by 5, the size of a contiguous object increases by one 5-foot cube, and the weakness increases by 3.
