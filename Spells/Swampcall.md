# Swampcall
![[icons-commodities-stone-stone-cratered-brown.webp|150]]

You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes [[Off-Guard]]. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty to Speeds (except Swim speed) is -15 feet.

* * *

**Heightened (3rd)** The range increases to 60 feet, and the area increases to a 20-foot burst.
