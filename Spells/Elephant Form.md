# Elephant Form
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-elephant-form.webp|150]]

You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying elephant or similar creature, such as a mammoth, mastodon, or anancus. This spell has the effects of _[[Dinosaur Form]]_, except you gain the following specific abilities instead of the form-specific abilities of dinosaur form.

*   Speed 40 feet;
*   **Melee** 1 foot, **Damage** 2d8 bludgeoning.
*   **Melee** 1 trunk (reach 10 feet), **Effect** grabbing trunk;
*   **Melee** 1 tusk (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d6 piercing.

**Grabbing Trunk** A creature up to two sizes smaller that's hit by your trunk is [[Grabbed]]. If you succeed at your [[Grapple]] check against a creature grabbed by your trunk, you can reposition the creature to another space within your trunk's reach.
