# Inevitable Destination
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-inevitable-destination.webp|150]]

You twist the paths of the target, ensuring that each one leads to you. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The spell has no effect.

**Success** Your pull hampers the target's footsteps. It takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The target can't move any farther from you than it was when you Cast the Spell, though it can move in such a way that it maintains an equal distance. If you move farther away from the target than the initial distance, the spell ends. The targeted foe can attempt to [[Escape]] against your spell DC. If it succeeds, the spell ends.

**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the target is pulled 10 feet closer to you and falls [[Prone]], tripping in its haste to move toward you.
