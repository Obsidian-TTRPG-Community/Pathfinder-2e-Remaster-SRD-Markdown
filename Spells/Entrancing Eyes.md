# Entrancing Eyes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-entrancing-eyes.webp|150]]

Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] and [[Fascinated]].

**Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 4]], Fascinated, and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [[Concealed]] from the target.

* * *

During any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already Fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
