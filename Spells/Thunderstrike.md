![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shocking-grasp.webp|150]]

You call down a tendril of lightning that cracks with thunder, dealing 1d12 electricity damage and 1d4 sonic damage to the target with a basic Reflex save. A target wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a –1 circumstance bonus to its save, and if damaged by the spell is [[Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d12 electricity and 1d4 sonic.
