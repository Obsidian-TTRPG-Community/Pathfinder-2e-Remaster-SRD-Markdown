# Wilding Word

Your patron’s majesty—or their displeasure—comes in a growl from your throat, making other creatures reluctant to harm you. The target must attempt a Will save; if the creature is an animal, fungus, or plant, it takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** When the target attempts an attack roll or skill check that would harm you, it takes a -2 status penalty to its roll.

**Failure** As success, but the target also becomes [[Sickened 1]] each time it damages you.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the sickened value is 2.
