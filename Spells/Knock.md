# Knock
![[icons-skills-melee-unarmed-punch-fist-blue.webp|150]]

You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock, or container with an Athletics or a Thievery check. You can attempt a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting knock, and you add your level even if you're untrained.

_Knock_ counteracts _[[Lock]]_.
