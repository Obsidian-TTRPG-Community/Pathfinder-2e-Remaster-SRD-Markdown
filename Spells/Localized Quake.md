# Localized Quake
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-localized-quake.webp|150]]

You shake the earth, toppling nearby creatures. Choose whether the spell's area is a 15-foot emanation or a 15-foot cone when you cast it. Each creature in the area standing on solid ground takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that fails its save also falls prone.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6.
