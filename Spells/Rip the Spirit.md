# Rip the Spirit
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-rip-the-spirit.webp|150]]

You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes 5d6 void damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [[Drained 1]] if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

1 **(somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.

2 **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is 10d6 void damage instead of 5d6.

3 **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage increases by 1d6, or by 2d6 for the 2-action version.
