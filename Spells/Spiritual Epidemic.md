# Spiritual Epidemic
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-spiritual-epidemic.webp|150]]

You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious trap in its essence. The target must attempt a Will save. Any creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it's affected is targeted by spiritual epidemic and must also attempt a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.
