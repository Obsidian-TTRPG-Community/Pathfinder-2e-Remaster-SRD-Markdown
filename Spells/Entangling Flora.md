# Entangling Flora
![[icons-magic-nature-root-vines-grow-brown.webp|150]]

Plants and fungi burst out or quickly grow, entangling creatures. All surfaces in the area are difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it's also [[Immobilized]] for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to [[Escape]] to remove these effects.
