# Chromatic Image
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chromatic-image.webp|150]]

You call forth three illusory images of yourself, and each of the four of you takes on a different color, your colors all shifting each time someone attacks you. This has the effects of _[[Mirror Image]]_, except that whenever a foe destroys one of the images, roll 1d4 to see which color the image was when it was destroyed. The attacker takes the corresponding effect.

1.  **Red** 5 fire damage and 5 mental damage.
2.  **Orange** 5 acid damage and 5 mental damage.
3.  **Yellow** 5 electricity damage and 5 mental damage.
4.  **Green** 5 poison damage and 5 mental damage, plus it's [[Frightened 1]].
