# Noxious Vapors
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-noxious-vapors.webp|150]]

You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you [[Cast a Spell|Cast the Spell]] takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [[Sickened 1]]. All creatures in the area become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the smoke become Concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 poison.
