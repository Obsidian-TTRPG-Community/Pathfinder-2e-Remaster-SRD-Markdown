# Unblinking Flame Revelation
![[icons-magic-light-explosion-beam-impact-silhouette.webp|150]]

You light your foe with revealing flame. The GM attempts a secret counteract check against each illusion affecting the creature; on a success, you suppress the illusion for the duration, rather than end the effect.
