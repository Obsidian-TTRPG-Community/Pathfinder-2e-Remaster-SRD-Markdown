# Scouring Sand
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-scouring-sand.webp|150]]

You blast the area with grit that scours away soil and gets into creatures' eyes. For the duration of the spell, any plant-based difficult terrain smaller than a tree becomes loose, allowing each 5-foot square of it to be cleared with a single Interact action. In addition, _scouring sand_ attempts to counteract _[[Entangling Flora]]_ and other effects that create or manipulate plant-based terrain in its area. Successfully counteracting an effect removes only the portion of its area that overlaps with _scouring sand's_ area. After one such attempt, the effect is temporarily immune to _scouring sand's_ counteract for 24 hours. Each creature in the area when you Cast this Spell or that ends its turn in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to get the sand out of its eyes.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Blinded]] for its next action.

**Heightened (3rd)** Once per round when you Sustain the Spell, you can move the center of the burst to a spot within range.

**Heightened (6th)** As the 3rd-level version, except the range is 120 feet and the area is a 20-foot burst.
