# Phase Familiar
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-phase-familiar.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your familiar would take damage.

* * *

Your patron momentarily recalls your familiar to the ether, shifting it from its solid, physical form into a ghostly version of itself. Against the triggering damage, your familiar gains resistance 5 to all damage and is immune to precision damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the resistance by 2.
