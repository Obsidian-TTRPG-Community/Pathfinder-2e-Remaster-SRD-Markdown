# Telepathy
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-telepathy.webp|150]]

You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

**Heightened (6th)** You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language _telepathy_ loses the linguistic trait.
