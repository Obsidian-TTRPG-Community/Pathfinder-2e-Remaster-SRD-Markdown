# Ectoplasmic Interstice
![[icons-creatures-magical-spirit-undead-ghost-blue.webp|150]]

You force the Material and Ethereal Planes to partially overlap, creating a zone that causes incorporeal and spiritual entities to take on many of the aspects of corporeal creatures. Within the ectoplasmic interstice, incorporeal creatures cannot pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects. An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal Strength modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of -5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its Athletics modifier by 9 accordingly. Attacks against creatures that are within the interstice overcome resistances as if they were by [[Ghost Touch]] weapons.
