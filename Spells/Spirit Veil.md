# Spirit Veil
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-spirit-veil.webp|150]]

You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. You become [[Concealed]] to all creatures, and you are [[Hidden]] from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of _[[Invisibility]]_, but against all the undead creature's precise senses. If you physically [[Interact]] with an undead creature or use a hostile action, the spell ends.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically Interacts with an undead creature or uses a hostile action.
