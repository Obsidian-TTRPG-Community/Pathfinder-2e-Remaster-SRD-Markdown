# Day's Weight
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-days-weight.webp|150]]

You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Fatigued]] and [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 1 for the duration.

**Critical Failure** The target is fatigued and [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for the duration. The fatigued condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
