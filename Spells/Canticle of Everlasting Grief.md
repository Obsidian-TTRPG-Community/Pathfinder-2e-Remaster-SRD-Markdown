# Canticle of Everlasting Grief
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-canticle-of-everlasting-grief.webp|150]]

You create a melody distilled from pure grief, conveying the inevitable loss of everything your target cherishes, audible to only them. The target takes 10d6 mental damage depending on its Will save. A creature cursed by this spell can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses, for the duration noted in the degree of success.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage, is [[Frightened 1]], and is cursed for 1 round.

**Failure** The target takes full damage, is [[Frightened 1|Frightened 3]], and is cursed for 1 week.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [[Frightened 1|Frightened 4]], and is cursed for an unlimited duration. While the curse remains, the target's allies are also affected by the curse while within 15 feet of the creature.
