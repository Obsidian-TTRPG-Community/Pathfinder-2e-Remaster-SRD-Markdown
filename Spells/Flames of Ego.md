# Flames of Ego
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-flames-of-ego.webp|150]]

Elegant flames of incredible beauty coruscate across the target's body, creating overconfidence and carelessness. The target attempts a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target sheds bright light in a 20 foot emanation (and dim light to the next 40 feet) and becomes [[Fascinated]] with itself for 1 round. It must spend at least 1 action on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence. Using actions that include such a display—such as using [[Perform]] to show off—count toward this requirement.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute and the target can't act hostile toward a creature until that creature acts hostile toward the target.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target must spend at least 2 actions on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence.
