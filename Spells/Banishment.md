# Banishment
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-banishment.webp|150]]

You send the target back to its home plane. The target must attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while Casting this Spell and add a cost to the spell to give the creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. The cost must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature. This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.
