# Veil of Dreams
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-veil-of-dreams.webp|150]]

Your patron draws the target into a drowsy state, causing daydreams and sluggishness. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes a -1 status penalty to Perception, attack rolls, and Will saves. This penalty increases to -2 for Will saves against sleep effects.

**Failure** As success, and any time the target uses a concentrate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat or the action is disrupted.
