# Electrified Crystal Ward
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-electrified-crystal-ward.webp|150]]

You create an [[Electric Latch Rune]] hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard's listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous _electric latch rune_ is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The hazard's damage increases by 1d12.
