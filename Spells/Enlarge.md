# Enlarge
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-enlarge.webp|150]]

Bolstered by magical power, the target grows to size Large. Its equipment grows with it but returns to natural size if removed. The creature is [[Clumsy 1]]. Its reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if it started out Tiny), and it gains a +2 status bonus to melee damage. This spell has no effect on a Large or larger creature.

**Heightened (4th)** The creature instead grows to size Huge. The status bonus to melee damage is +4 and the creature's reach increases by 10 feet (or 15 feet if the creature started out Tiny). The spell has no effect on a Huge or larger creature.

**Heightened (6th)** Choose either the 2nd-rank or 4th-rank version of this spell and apply its effects to up to 10 willing creatures.
