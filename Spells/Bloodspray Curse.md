You inflict a curse upon the target that causes any wound to gush blood. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** For 1 minute, the first time each round that the target takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage from a single Strike, it takes 2d6 additional damage of the same type.

**Failure** As success, but when it takes the additional damage, it also takes 2d6 bleed.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The additional damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6.
