# Haunting Hymn
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-haunting-hymn.webp|150]]

You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear. The hymn deals 1d8 sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save. If a target critically fails the save, it's also [[Deafened]] for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
