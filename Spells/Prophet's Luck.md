# Prophet's Luck
![[icons-magic-perception-orb-crystal-ball-scrying.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or a creature within range attempts a saving throw against an obvious threat.

* * *

You prophesize the result of the triggering saving throw as either a success (including a critical success) or a failure (including a critical failure). The target gains a +1 status bonus to the save if you predict success or a –1 status penalty if you predict failure. If you predict the result correctly, fortune favors you, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If you predict incorrectly, fortune spurns the target, imparting a –1 status penalty to its saving throws.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** The save bonus or penalty increases to +2 or –2.

**Heightened (9th)** The save bonus or penalty increases to +3 or –3.
