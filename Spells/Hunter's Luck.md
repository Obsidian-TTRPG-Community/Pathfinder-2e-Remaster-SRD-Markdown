# Hunter's Luck
![[icons-equipment-head-hat-cocked-feather-green.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

You have a preternatural ability to remember details about your foes. Roll the triggering check twice and use the better result.
