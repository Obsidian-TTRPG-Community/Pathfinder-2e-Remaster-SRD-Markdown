**Critical Success** The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be restored by the healing effect, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be restored.

**Failure** The creature regains only half the number of Hit Points that would be restored.

**Critical Failure** The creature does not regain Hit Points from the healing effect.
