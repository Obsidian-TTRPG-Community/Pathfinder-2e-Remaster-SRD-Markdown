# Lay on Hands
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-lay-on-hands.webp|150]]

Your hands become infused with vitality energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch.

If you use lay on hands on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round.

Against an undead target, you deal 1d6 damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a -2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by 1d6.
