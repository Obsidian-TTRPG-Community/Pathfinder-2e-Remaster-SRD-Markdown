# Guided Introspection
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chromatic-image.webp|150]]

You guide the target in examining their innermost feelings, their behaviors, and the motivations behind their actions, granting them clarity and insight. The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion and fear.

If the target would become [[Confused]], they reduce the duration of the confused condition by 1 round, to a minimum of 1 round. If the target would become frightened or stupefied, they reduce the value of the frightened or stupefied condition by 1, to a minimum of 1. Once any of these conditions occur, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+3)** The status bonus increases by 1.
