# Touch of Obedience
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-touch-of-obedience.webp|150]]

Your imperious touch erodes the target's willpower, making it easier to control. The target attempts a Will save. Regardless of the result, it's then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] until the end of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute and is forced to its knees, becoming prone.
