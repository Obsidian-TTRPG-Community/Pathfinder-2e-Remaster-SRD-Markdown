# Hymn of Healing
![[icons-magic-life-cross-beam-green.webp|150]]

Your glorious singing mends wounds and provides a temporary respite from harm. The target gains fast healing 2. When you Cast the Spell and the first time each round you Sustain the Spell, the target gains 2 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The fast healing and temporary Hit Points each increase by 2.
