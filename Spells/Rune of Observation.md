# Rune of Observation
![[icons-magic-perception-orb-eye-scrying.webp|150]]

You inscribe an invisible eye-shaped rune in the air, creating a sensor as [[Clairvoyance]]. When created, this eye must be in your line of sight.

Each time the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations
