# Summon Irii
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-summon-irii.webp|150]]

You cast your spell, whisper your words of power, and find that an irii is already here-indeed, they have always been here, and always were, and always will be. The temporal being occupies the space of a Medium creature and has a Speed of 60 feet and a fly Speed of 60 feet. When you Cast this Spell, choose whether it summons a fate irii or a fortune irii.

*   **Fate** The fate stands before you with its stained-glass wings and animal-headed gaze, floating eyes circling about it  
    **Arrive** (divination, fortune, lawful, prediction)  
    _Decree the Immutability of Time_ While within 30 feet of the fate, you and your allies who roll below 10 on a d20 for an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check get a 10 instead  
    **Depart** (divination, misfortune, prediction)  
    _Observe the Inevitability of Destiny_ Each enemy within a 30 foot emanation must attempt a Will save. If a creature fails its save, until the end of its next turn, any time it rolls above 10 on a d20 for an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, it gets a 10 instead.
*   **Fortune** The fortune stands before you with its golden horns and moth-scale wings, a sly smirk on its elfin face  
    **Arrive** (chaotic, divination, fortune, prediction) _Decree the Chaos of Infinity_ While within 30 feet of the fortune, you and your allies roll twice and take the higher roll on all damage rolls, Perception checks, and saving throws  
    **Depart** (divination, misfortune, prediction) _Sunder Eternity's Authority_ Each enemy within a 30 foot emanation must attempt a Will save. A creature that fails its save must roll twice and take the lower result on all damage rolls, Perception checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn.
