# Angelic Halo
![[icons-magic-light-explosion-star-glow-blue.webp|150]]

You gain an angelic halo with an aura that increases allies' healing from the _[[Heal]]_ spell. Allies in your halo's emanation who are healed by a heal spell gain a status bonus to Hit Points regained equal to double the heal spell's level.
