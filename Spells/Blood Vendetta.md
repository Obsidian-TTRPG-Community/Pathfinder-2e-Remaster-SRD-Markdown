**Requirements** You can bleed.

You curse the target, punishing it for having the audacity to spill your blood. The target takes 2d6 bleed and must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half the persistent bleed damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the persistent bleed damage.
