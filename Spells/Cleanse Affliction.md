# Cleanse Affliction
![[icons-consumables-fruit-berry-clustered-white.webp|150]]

Gentle restorative magic pushes back the effects of toxins and more complex maladies. Choose an affliction on the target, such as a curse, disease, or poison. If it has advanced past stage one, reduce the stage by one. This reduction can be applied only once to a given case of an affliction, with the case ending when it's completely cured. Although the reduction can't occur again, heightened versions of this spell attempt to counteract with each casting.

**Heightened (3rd)** Attempt to counteract the affliction if it is a disease or poison.

**Heightened (4th)** Attempt to counteract the affliction if it is a curse, disease, or poison.
