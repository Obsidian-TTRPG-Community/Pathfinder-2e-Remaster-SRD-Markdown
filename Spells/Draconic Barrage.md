# Draconic Barrage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-draconic-barrage.webp|150]]

You shape energy into one incorporeal tiny dragon (or serpentine creature) that flits around you. The specific dragon is random; roll [[/r 1d6 #dragon]] on the table below for each dragon evoked to determine which type of dragon you create. While the spell persists, you can command one of your dragons to spit a missile of energy at a creature within 60 feet by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This is a ranged Strike that uses your spell attack bonus and deals 1d6 damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with the damage type depending on the dragon. A dragon's breath Strike uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Once a dragon has used its breath Strike, it winks out of existence; when you have no dragons remaining, the spell ends.
