# Compel True Name
![[icons-magic-control-debuff-chains-shackles-movement-purple.webp|150]]

You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the linguistic trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 week, and learns your true name.

**Success** The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name.

**Failure** The target does as you command. The spell has a duration of 10 minutes, or until the target has completed a finite instruction or the instructions become selfdestructive. The creature is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 hour.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.
