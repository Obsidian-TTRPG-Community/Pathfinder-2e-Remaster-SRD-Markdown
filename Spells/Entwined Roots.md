# Entwined Roots
![[icons-magic-nature-root-vine-barrier-wall-brown.webp|150]]

Slithering roots gird you and your allies in layers of flexible wooden protection. Each affected creature gains resistance 5 to bludgeoning and piercing damage. Whenever a creature protected by these roots is targeted by a ranged weapon attack but takes no damage (such as if the attack missed or the damage was reduced to 0 by resistance), the roots snatch up the ammunition or thrown weapon and hold it. The protected creature can retrieve the thrown weapon or ammunition as an Interact action.

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** The resistances increase to 10.

**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 15.
