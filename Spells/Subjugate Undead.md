# Subjugate Undead
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-subjugate-undead.webp|150]]

You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being controlled by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting subjugate undead again ends any previous subjugate undead you cast.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The undead creature becomes a minion under your control for 1 minute. The spell is dismissed if you or an ally takes a hostile action against the minion undead.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes.
