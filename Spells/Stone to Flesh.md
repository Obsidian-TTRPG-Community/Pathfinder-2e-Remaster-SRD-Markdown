# Stone to Flesh
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-stone-to-flesh.webp|150]]

Manipulating the fundamental particles of matter, you convert stone into flesh and blood. You restore a [[Petrified]] creature to its normal state or transform a stone object into a mass of inert flesh (without stone's Hardness) in roughly the same shape.
