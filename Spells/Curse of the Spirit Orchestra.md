# Curse of the Spirit Orchestra
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-alarm.webp|150]]

You summon an [[Invisible]], insubstantial group of extraplanar musicians who follow the target and play distracting music to hinder its actions. The music the musicians play is as inappropriate to the action as possible (for example, loud drumbeats as the target tries to [[Sneak]] or silly children's songs when the target tries to orate in a serious manner). The musicians can't be reasoned with or harmed.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** Until the start of your next turn, the target must roll twice and use the worse result when it attempts a Diplomacy, Intimidation, Performance, or Stealth check. When the target rolls a critical success on any skill check, it gets a success instead. When the target rolls a failure on any skill check, it gets a critical failure instead.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 hour.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is unlimited.
