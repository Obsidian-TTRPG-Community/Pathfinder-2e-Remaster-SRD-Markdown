# Kinetic Ram
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-telekinetic-ram.webp|150]]

Gathering kinetic energy, you either focus it in a straight line or disperse it as an encircling ripple. Any creature targeted by this spell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you (or 20 feet on a critical failure). The spell's area or range and how many creatures it affects is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

* * *

1 The spell targets one creature within 15 feet.

2 The spell targets one creature within 30 feet. The distance the target is pushed if it fails is doubled, and on a critical failure, the target is also knocked [[Prone]] and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

3 The spell targets all creatures in a 5 foot emanation.
