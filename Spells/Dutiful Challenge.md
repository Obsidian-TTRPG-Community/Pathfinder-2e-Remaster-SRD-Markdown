![[icons-sundries-flags-banner-sword-blue.webp|150]]

As you challenge an enemy, you take some of its attention away from your allies. The target takes a -1 status penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against creatures other than you, and you take a -1 status penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against creatures other than the target.

Each time a creature other than you uses a hostile action that affects the challenged enemy, the enemy can attempt a Will save. On a success, the enemy no longer takes the penalty against that creature. You can Dismiss the spell, and it ends automatically if you or the target is defeated.
