# Wave of Despair
![[icons-creatures-slimes-slime-face-teeth-purple.webp|150]]

You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is [[Slowed 1]] for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically slowed 1 for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** The area increases to a 60-foot cone.
