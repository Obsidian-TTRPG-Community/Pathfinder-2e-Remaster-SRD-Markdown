![[icons-creatures-magical-spirit-undead-ghost-purple.webp|150]]

You make subtle changes to yourself to adapt to the situation. Choose one of the following options that applies to you.

*   If you are in water, you gain a swim Speed equal to half your Speed.
*   If you are in water, you become able to breathe water.
*   If it's too dark for you to see, you gain [[2-Mechanics/Character Building/Ancestry Features/Darkvision|Darkvision]].
*   If you are in an environment of severe heat or severe cold, you are protected from the effects of severe heat or severe cold, and the spell lasts 10 minutes.
