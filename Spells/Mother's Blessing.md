# Mother's Blessing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-mother's-blessing.webp|150]]

You attempt to purify and stabilize the life inside of Ulgrem-Axaan's last remaining clutch of eggs. With its blessing, you wash the eggs clean from the filth of undeath and bury them in warm sand by the banks of a river in Garund.

**Critical Success** The ritual is successful and the eggs hatch, giving life to an ancient species brought to the brink of extinction by the destruction of their home.

**Success** As critical success, but only half of the eggs hatch (rounded up). You can try again with the remaining eggs.

**Failure** No effect, and you must wait a week to try again.

**Critical Failure** 90% of the eggs shatter (rounded up). You must wait a month to try again.
