# Spiritual Anamnesis
![[icons-magic-acid-dissolve-bone-skull.webp|150]]

Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target's mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Slowed 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Slowed 1]] for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[Stunned 1|Stunned 3]].
