You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects. If a creature is in the aura when you Cast the Spell or when a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.

**Success** The creature is [[Fascinated]] with you for its next action, then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
