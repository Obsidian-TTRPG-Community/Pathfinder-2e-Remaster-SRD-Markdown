# Song of Marching
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-song-of-marching.webp|150]]

You maintain a brisk performance that keeps allies on the move. You and your allies in the area can [[Hustle]] for the spell's duration, in addition to your other exploration activities (your exploration activity is Sustaining this spell). You and your allies then become temporarily immune for 1 day.

If you enter an encounter while performing this song, you can use your Performance modifier for the initiative roll. You and your affected allies also receive a +1 status bonus to that initiative roll.
