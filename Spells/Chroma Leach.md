# Chroma Leach
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chroma-leach.webp|150]]

Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute and [[Drained 1]]. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] (although magic such as _[[Restoration]]_ can reduce or remove these conditions).
