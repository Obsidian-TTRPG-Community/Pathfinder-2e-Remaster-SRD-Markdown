# Faerie Fire
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-faerie-fire.webp|150]]

All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the duration. Visible creatures can't be [[Concealed]] while affected by faerie fire. If the creatures are [[Invisible]], they are Concealed while affected by faerie fire, rather than being [[Undetected]].
