# Unfolding Wind Buffet
![[icons-magic-air-fog-gas-smoke-swirling-white.webp|150]]

You surround your unarmed attacks with the speed and force of air. Make three unarmed Strikes against the same target. If at least one was a successful hit, the target must attempt a Fortitude save or be pushed back 5 feet for each normal hit from the buffet, plus 10 feet for each critical hit.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is pushed back half the normal distance.

**Failure** The target is pushed back the normal distance.

**Critical Failure** The target is pushed back double the normal distance and then knocked [[Prone]].
