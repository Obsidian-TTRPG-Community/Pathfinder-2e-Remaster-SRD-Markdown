# Owb Pact
![[icons-sundries-scrolls-scroll-writing-tan-grey.webp|150]]

You call upon an owb to assist you in a goal. Only caligni callers can use this ritual with relative safety. If a different type of caligni attempts this ritual, they use an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their check. If a non-caligni attempts this ritual, the result is an automatic critical failure.

* * *

**Critical Success** You conjure the owb. It decides your goals closely match its own and doesn't request a favor in return.

**Success** You conjure the owb. It isn't eager to pursue the task, so it requires a favor in return.

**Failure** You don't conjure an owb.

**Critical Failure** You conjure an owb, but it deems you unworthy and siphons away some of your soul energy. All casters become [[Doomed 1|Doomed 2]].
