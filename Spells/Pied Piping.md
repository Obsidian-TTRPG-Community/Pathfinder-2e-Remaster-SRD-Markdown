Your performance enraptures listeners, compelling them to follow you. Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. Once per turn, you can Sustain the composition to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can Dismiss the spell.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Fascinated]] with you.

**Failure** The creature is fascinated by you and uses all its actions to move toward you and compliment your performance. This effect ends if a hostile action is used against the affected creature.

**Critical Failure** The target gains the minion trait and is controlled by you. This effect ends if a hostile action is used against the affected creature, or if you direct the creature to use any action that causes it harm.
