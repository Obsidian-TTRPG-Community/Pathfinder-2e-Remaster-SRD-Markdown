# Familiar's Face
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-familiars-face.webp|150]]

The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as _[[See the Unseen]]_, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use [[Command an Animal]] on the target as part of [[Sustain|Sustaining this Spell]]. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you [[Cast a Spell|Cast this Spell]].
