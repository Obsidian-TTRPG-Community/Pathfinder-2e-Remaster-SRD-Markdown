# Timber
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-timber.webp|150]]

You create a small dead tree in your space that falls over on anyone in its path, then immediately decomposes. Any creature in the area takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked for a loop, making it [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d4.
