# Percussive Impact
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-percussive-impact.webp|150]]

You lob a compressed ball of sound at a foe. The ball explodes on impact, unleashing a powerful blast of sound. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, you deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 sonic splash damage. On a critical success, the target is also [[Deafened]] for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The bludgeoning damages increases by 4d8, the sonic splash damage increases by 1d4, and the duration of the deafened condition increases by 2 rounds.
