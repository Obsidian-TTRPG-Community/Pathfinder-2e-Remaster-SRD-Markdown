# Fortify Summoning
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-augment-summoning.webp|150]]

As you call a creature to your side, your magic transforms its body, heightening its ferocity and fortifying its resilience. The target gains a +1 status bonus to all checks and DCs (including its AC) for the duration of its summoning, up to 1 minute.
