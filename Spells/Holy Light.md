# Holy Light
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-searing-light.webp|150]]

You shine a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target has the unholy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.

**Success** The target takes full damage. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, holy light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against unholy creatures increases by 2d6.
