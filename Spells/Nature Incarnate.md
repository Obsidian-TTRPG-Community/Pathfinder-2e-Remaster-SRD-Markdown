# Nature Incarnate
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-nature-incarnate.webp|150]]

The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   30 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Enfeebled 1]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +36, unless your own is higher. You gain specific abilities based on the incarnation you choose:
*   **Green Man** Speed 40 feet, climb 40 feet;
    *   **Melee**1 vines (reach 30 feet, versatile P), **Damage** 6d8+12 bludgeoning;
    *   **Ranged**1 thorns (range 100 feet), **Damage** 6d6+6 piercing;
    *   **Green Caress** (aura, primal) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a DC resolve fortitude against your spell DC or become [[Clumsy 1]] for 1 round ([[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure).

*   **Kaiju**
    *   Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage;
    *   **Melee**1 jaws (reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d10+10 piercing;
    *   **Melee**1 claws (agile, reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d8+8 slashing;
    *   **Melee**1 foot (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 6d6+10 bludgeoning;
    *   **Unstoppable** You are immune to being [[Immobilized]] and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; **Trample**3 You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your spell DC.
