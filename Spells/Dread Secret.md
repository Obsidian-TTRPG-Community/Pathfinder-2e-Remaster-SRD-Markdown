# Dread Secret
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-rune-glow-green.webp|150]]

You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [[Recall Knowledge]] or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.

**Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [[Frightened 1]] from the revelation of its dread secret.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is [[Frightened 1|Frightened 3]].
