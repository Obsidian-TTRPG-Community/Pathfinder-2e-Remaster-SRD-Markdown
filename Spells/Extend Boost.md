# Extend Boost
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-extend-boost.webp|150]]

You focus on the intricacies of the magic binding you to your eidolon to extend the duration of your boost eidolon or reinforce eidolon spell. If your next action is to cast _[[Boost Eidolon]]_ or _[[Reinforce Eidolon]]_, attempt a skill check with the skill associated with the tradition of magic you gain from your eidolon (such as Nature for a primal eidolon). The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
