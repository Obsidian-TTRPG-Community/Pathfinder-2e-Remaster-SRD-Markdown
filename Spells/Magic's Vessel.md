# Magic's Vessel
![[icons-skills-melee-maneuver-sword-katana-yellow.webp|150]]

A creature becomes a divine receptacle for pure magical energy. The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. Each time you Cast a Spell from your spell slots, you automatically Sustain this spell and grant its target resistance to damage from spells equal to the spell's rank, until the start of your next turn.
