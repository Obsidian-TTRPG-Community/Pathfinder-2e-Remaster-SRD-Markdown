# Radiant Field
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-radiant-field.webp|150]]

You create an area of bright light. Creatures with [[Light Blindness]] that are [[Blinded]] by _radiant field_ and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains blinded for 1 round; this is an incapacitation effect.

This spell also suppresses magical darkness of your radiant field spell's level or lower.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [[Concealed]] to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.
