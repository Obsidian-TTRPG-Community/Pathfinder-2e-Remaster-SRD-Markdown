# Martyr's Intervention
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-martyrs-intervention.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within range would take damage that reduces it to 0 Hit Points

**Requirements** You don't have the wounded condition.

* * *

You shield a creature in dire need with your own life force, taking the harm upon yourself to save their life. The target is reduced to 1 Hit Point instead of 0 Hit Points. All remaining damage that was prevented from harming the target creature is instead dealt to you. Both you and the target become [[Wounded 1]]; targets who are already wounded increased their wounded value by 1.
