# Fey Disappearance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-fey-disapperance.webp|150]]

You become [[Invisible]] and ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Any hostile action you use ends this invisibility, but you still ignore natural difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** If you use a hostile action, the invisibility doesn't end.
