# Telekinetic Rend
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-telekinetic-rend.webp|150]]

Two non-overlapping 5 foot burst

* * *

Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space. You deal your choice of 1d6 bludgeoning or 1d6 slashing damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the bursts takes damage only once.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.

* * *

**Amp** Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage, instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails its save is also [[Stunned 1]].

**Amp Heightened (+2)** Both types of damage increase by 1d6 instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5 foot burst to the area.
