# Zeal for Battle
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-zeal-for-battle.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.

* * *

You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls. You each still use your own Perception modifier or other statistic to determine your results.
