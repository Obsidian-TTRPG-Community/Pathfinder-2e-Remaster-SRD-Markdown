# Whispering Quiet
![[icons-magic-sonic-explosion-shock-sound-wave.webp|150]]

You suppress sound in an area, preventing anyone from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent those in the area from talking or Casting a Spell, but no creature more than 5 feet away can hear its voice without succeeding at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory or linguistic effects as well as communication. Other sounds created in the area are muffled to a similar volume unless that sound is created by an effect with the sonic trait
