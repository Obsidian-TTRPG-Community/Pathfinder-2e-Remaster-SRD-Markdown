# Nymph's Token
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-nymphs-token.webp|150]]

You grant an ally a token of favor. You create a token, such as a lock of your hair or a flower, that persists for the spell's duration; as part of Casting the Spell, you can [[Interact]] to pass the token to an ally within your reach.

As long as the ally has the token on their person, they gain a +1 status bonus to Performance checks and Will saves.

You can [[Dismiss]] the spell as a free action.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** As long as the ally has the token on their person, you can cast spells that have a range of touch on them at a range of 30 feet.
