# Downpour
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-downpour.webp|150]]

You call forth a torrential downpour, which extinguishes nonmagical flames. Creatures in the area are [[Concealed]] and gain fire resistance 10. Creatures outside the area are Concealed to those inside the area. If a creature with weakness to water ends its turn in the area, the downpour triggers its weakness.
