# Imprint Message
![[icons-sundries-documents-document-writing-pink.webp|150]]

You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts _[[Object Reading]]_ on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a _[[Retrocognition]]_ spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with _[[Read Aura]]_ of a higher spell level than _imprint message_, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you [[Cast a Spell|Cast this Spell]], any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of _imprint message_ fade.
