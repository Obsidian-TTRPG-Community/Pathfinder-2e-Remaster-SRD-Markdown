You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed element. While in this form, you gain the corresponding trait and the elemental trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.

Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Dexterity based (air, fire, or metal) or Strength based (earth, water, or wood). If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Acrobatics (air, fire, or metal) or Athletics (earth, water, or wood) modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher.
