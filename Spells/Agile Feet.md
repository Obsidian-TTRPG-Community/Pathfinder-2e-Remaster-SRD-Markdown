# Agile Feet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-agile-feet.webp|150]]

The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting agile feet, you can Stride, Step, or [[Tumble Through]]; you can instead Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim if you have the appropriate Speed.
