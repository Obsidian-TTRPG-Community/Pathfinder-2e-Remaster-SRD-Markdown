# Ghostly Shift
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ghostly-shift.webp|150]]

Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out. You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 1.

* * *

**Amp** Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you [[Stride]], [[Burrow]], [[Swim]], or [[Fly]], you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to [[Tumble Through]], though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal 2d6 force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.

**Amp Heightened (+2)** Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by 1d6.
