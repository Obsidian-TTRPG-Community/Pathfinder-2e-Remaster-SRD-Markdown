# Allfood
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-tapas-brewers-regret.webp|150]]

You transform one object into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This allfood always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency, regardless of its original nature. One bulk of allfood provides enough sustenance to feed one Medium creature for a day.

After 1 day, if no one has eaten the allfood, it reverts to its original form. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature and most Tiny creatures eat one-sixteenth as much, while most Large creatures eat 10 times as much, Huge creatures need 100 times as much, and so on.

**Heightened (+1)** Double the maximum bulk (to a maximum of 256 bulk at 10th level).
