# Implement of Destruction
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-implement-of-destruction.webp|150]]

You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy's mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The effect is based on the target enemy's Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target enemy is unaffected.

**Success** The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the end of the spell's duration.

**Failure** The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 persistent,mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [[Doomed 1]] for as long as it takes this persistent mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The target weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent,mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the mental damage by 1d6 on a success, and increase the persistent mental damage by 1d6 on a failure or by 2d6 on a critical failure.
