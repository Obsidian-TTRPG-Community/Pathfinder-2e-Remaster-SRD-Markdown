# Aromatic Lure
![[icons-magic-nature-plant-glowing-white-purple.webp|150]]

You override a target's olfactory senses, luring them to a specific location through tantalizing false scents. Select a single square within range that is not hazardous or occupied by a creature. The target is drawn to the selected location, becoming euphoric upon arrival. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is distracted by the tantalizing scents, becoming [[Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] and moves toward the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 4]] and moves to the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way. If the creature reaches the destination, it must remain in that location for 1d4 rounds but can otherwise act normally.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** You target 1 additional creature, selecting a different square within range as their destination.
