# Levitate
![[icons-magic-light-projectile-stars-blue.webp|150]]

You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground. You can Sustain the spell to move the target up or down 10 feet. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.
