# Unity
![[icons-skills-movement-arrows-up-trio-red.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You and 1 or more allies within range are targeted by a spell or ability that allows a saving throw.

* * *

You put up a united defense. Each ally can use your saving throw modifier instead of its own against the triggering spell. Each ally decides individually which modifier to use.
