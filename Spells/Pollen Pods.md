![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-pollen-pods.webp|150]]

**Area** four unoccupied 5-foot squares, each of which is at least 20 feet apart

* * *

You cultivate four wooden bulbs, each filled with toxic pollen and sensitive to motion. When a creature enters a space adjacent to a bulb, or when a bulb is touched or damaged (each bulb has AC 5), the bulb blossoms and releases pollen in a 15 foot emanation. Creatures in the area take 8d8 poison damage and must attempt a Fortitude save with the following results.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage, becomes dazzled for 1 round, and becomes [[Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is dazzled for 1 round, and becomes [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8.
