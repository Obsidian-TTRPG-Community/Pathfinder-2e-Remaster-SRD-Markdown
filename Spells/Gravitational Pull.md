# Gravitational Pull
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-gravitational-pull.webp|150]]

By suddenly altering gravity, you pull the target toward you. The target is pulled 10 feet closer to you unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. On a critical failure, it's also knocked [[Prone]]. The effects of this spell change depending on the number of actions you spend when you Cast this Spell.

1 **(somatic)** The spell targets one creature.

2 **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one creature and pulls the target 20 feet instead of 10.

3 **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets up to 5 creatures.
