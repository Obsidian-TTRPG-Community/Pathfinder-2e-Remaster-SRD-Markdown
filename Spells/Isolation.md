# Isolation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-isolation.webp|150]]

You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes [[Invisible]], but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as _[[See the Unseen]]_ enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.

**Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
