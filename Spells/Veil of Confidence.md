# Veil of Confidence
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-veil-of-confidence.webp|150]]

You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [[Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition by 1, and whenever you would become Frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, _veil of confidence_ reduces your frightened value form that effect, and then ends.
