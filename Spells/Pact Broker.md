# Pact Broker
![[icons-sundries-documents-document-official-capital.webp|150]]

You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and doesn't take hostile actions against you and your allies, you take a -1 status penalty to Deception checks to Lie to them. If they refuse and take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and then take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target takes a -1 status penalty to attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.

**Critical Failure** The target takes a -2 status penalty to attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.
