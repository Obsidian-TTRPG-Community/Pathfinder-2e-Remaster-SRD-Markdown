# Know the Enemy
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-know-the-enemy.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You roll initiative and can see a creature, you succeed at an attack roll against a creature, or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells.

* * *

You quickly remind yourself of useful information. Use a Recall Knowledge action, rolling the appropriate skill check to identify the triggering creature's abilities. You can roll your check twice and use the better result.
