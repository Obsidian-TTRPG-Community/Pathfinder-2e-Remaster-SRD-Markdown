# Blazing Bolt
![[icons-magic-fire-projectile-fireball-smoke-orange.webp|150]]

You fire a ray of heat and flame. Make a spell attack roll against a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.

For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions. These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for _blazing bolt_. If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2-action and 3-action versions.
