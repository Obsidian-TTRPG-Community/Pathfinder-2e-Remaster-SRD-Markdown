# Ranger's Bramble
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-rangers-bramble.webp|150]]

You cause plants in the area to entangle your foes, with the effects of [[Entangling Flora]]. A creature that critically fails the save takes 2d4 bleed damage in addition to being [[Immobilized]]. [[Escape|Escaping]] your bramble doesn't end the bleed damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The bleed damage on a critical failure increases by 1d4.
