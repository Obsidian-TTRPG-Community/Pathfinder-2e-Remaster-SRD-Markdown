# Earthworks
![[icons-magic-earth-barrier-stone-explosion-debris.webp|150]]

With a ripple of earth, you raise small barriers from the ground. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. The spell's area is a 5 foot burst if you spent 1 action to cast it, a 10 foot burst if you spent 2 actions, or a 15 foot burst if you spent 3 actions. A creature can Interact to clear the barriers from one 5-foot square adjacent to it.

**Heightened (4th)** You pull the barriers to float in the air, causing the spell to function as difficult terrain for flying creatures
