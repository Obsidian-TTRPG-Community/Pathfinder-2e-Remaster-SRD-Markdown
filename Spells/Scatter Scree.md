# Scatter Scree
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-scatter-scree.webp|150]]

You evoke a jumble of rocks in the area. The scattering rocks deal 2d4 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area, with a basic Reflex save. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A creature can Interact to clear a square of this scree. If you cast this spell again, any previous scatter scree you have cast ends.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
