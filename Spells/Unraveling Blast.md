# Unraveling Blast
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-seal-fate.webp|150]]

You unleash a small blast of potential that destroys one of a creature's possible futures, leaving them reeling. You deal 2d4 mental damage to the creature, and it must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half the mental damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Off-Guard]] until the start of its turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, becomes [[Stunned 1]], and is off-guard until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 3d4.
