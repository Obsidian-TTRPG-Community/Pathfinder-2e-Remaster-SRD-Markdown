# Elemental Toss
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-elemental-toss.webp|150]]

With a flick of your wrist, you fling a chunk of your elemental matter at your foe. Make a spell attack roll, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage (or fire damage if your element is fire) on a success, and double damage on a critical success. This spell has your element's trait.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.
