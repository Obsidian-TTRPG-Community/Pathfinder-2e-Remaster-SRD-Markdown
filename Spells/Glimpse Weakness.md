![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-glimpse-weakness.webp|150]]

You glimpse a loose scale, a seam in a foe's armor, or a similar weakness, aiding your allies in landing a precise hit. The first ally that hits the target with a successful Strike deals additional precision damage equal to 1 + this spell's level, and then the spell ends.

* * *

**Amp** The additional precision damage is 1d4+1.

**Amp Heightened (+2)** The additional precision damage increases by 1d4+1.
