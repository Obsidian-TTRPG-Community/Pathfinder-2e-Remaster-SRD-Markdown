# Lament
![[icons-magic-fire-elemental-fire-humanoid.webp|150]]

You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies' hearts and deals 1d8 mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by emotion effects, _lament_ deals additional mental damage equal to the counteract level of the highest-level effect.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.
