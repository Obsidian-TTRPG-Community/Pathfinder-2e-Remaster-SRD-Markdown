# Cave Fangs
![[icons-magic-earth-barrier-stone-explosion-spiked.webp|150]]

Sharp flowstone formations protrude from the ground and ceiling, dealing 6d6 piercing damage to creatures in the area with a basic Reflex save. Densely packed with protrusions, the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. The protrusions turn to dust when the spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
