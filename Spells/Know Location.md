# Know Location
![[icons-sundries-documents-document-torn-diagram-tan.webp|150]]

You create an invisible anchor at a location within range (even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect), as long as you can identify the location by its appearance (or other identifying features). You innately know the direction towards that location, including relative depth, but not the distance. Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could instead lead to an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined by the GM. This spell doesn't help you find a suitable route to the location nor assist you in overcoming obstacles on the way there.

**Heightened (3rd)** The range is 10 miles.

**Heightened (5th)** The range is 100 miles.

**Heightened (7th)** The range is planetary and you can create an anchor at a location you've viewed with scrying or similar effects.
