# Peaceful Rest
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-gentle-repose.webp|150]]

The targeted corpse doesn't decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for example, _[[Raise Dead]]_), do not count the duration of _peaceful rest_ against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.

**Heightened (5th)** The spell's duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast and requires a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp).
