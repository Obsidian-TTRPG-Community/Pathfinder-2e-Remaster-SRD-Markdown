# Hunter's Vision
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-hunters-vision.webp|150]]

Your target glows with a magical aura visible only to you and those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and others sharing your [[Hunt Prey]] benefits even if it wouldn't normally be due to lighting or the [[Concealed]] or [[Invisible]] conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your sight. You ignore the flat check against the target due to the Concealed condition, and the target isn't automatically [[Hidden]] from you due to darkness or being Invisible.
