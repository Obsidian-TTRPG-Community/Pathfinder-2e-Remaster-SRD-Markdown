# Howling Blizzard
![[icons-magic-water-vortex-water-whirlpool.webp|150]]

Freezing winds extend from your hands, pushing away from you with great force. If you Cast this Spell with 2 actions, it has an area of a 60-foot cone; if you Cast this Spell with 3 actions, it has a range of 500 feet and an area of a 30-foot burst. Each creature in the area takes 10d6 cold damage with a basic Reflex save. Snowdrifts and icy gales fill the area until the start of your next turn, making the area difficult terrain.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
