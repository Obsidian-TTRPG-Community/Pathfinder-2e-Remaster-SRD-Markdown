# Cornucopia
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-goodberry.webp|150]]

Vines twine into a wicker horn in your hands, and out spills a single fruit, nut, or similar small bit of produce. A creature who eats the produce with an Interact action regains 1d6+4 HP. The cornucopia, as well as any unconsumed pieces of fruit, wither away at the end of the duration.

**Heightened (+1)** The cornucopia produces an additional piece of food. A creature can consume any amount of food from the same casting with a single Interact action. Eating six pieces of produce from the cornucopia gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.
