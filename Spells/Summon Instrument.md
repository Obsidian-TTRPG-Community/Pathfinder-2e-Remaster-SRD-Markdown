# Summon Instrument
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-summon-instrument.webp|150]]

You materialize a [[Musical Instrument (Handheld)]] in your grasp. The instrument is typical for its type, but it plays only for you. It vanishes when the spell ends. If you cast _summon instrument_ again, any instrument you previously summoned disappears.

**Heightened (5th)** The instrument is instead a [[Musical Instrument (Virtuoso handheld)]]
