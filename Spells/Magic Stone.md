# Magic Stone
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-magic-stone.webp|150]]

You pour vitality energy into ordinary stones, granting them temporary magical properties. You can target 1 non-magical stone or sling bullet for every action you use [[Cast a Spell|Casting this Spell]]. The stones must be unattended or carried by you or a willing ally. The stones become _+1 striking disrupting [[Sling Bullets]]_. Each stone can be used only once, after which it crumbles to dust.
