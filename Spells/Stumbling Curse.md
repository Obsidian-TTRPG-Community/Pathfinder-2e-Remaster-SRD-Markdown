# Stumbling Curse
![[icons-skills-toxins-cup-goblet-poisoned-spilled.webp|150]]

With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes a -2 status penalty to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.

**Failure** As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.
