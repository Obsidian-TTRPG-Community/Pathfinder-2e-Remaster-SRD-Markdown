# Healer's Blessing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-healers-blessing.webp|150]]

Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to vital energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.

The target regains additional Hit Points from _healer's blessing_ only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once, when they are first healed.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
