![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-acid-storm.webp|150]]

You hurl a bolt of saltwater from your extended hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range.

**Critical Success** The creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute as saltwater sprays into its eyes. The creature can spend an Interact action to rub its eyes and end the blinded condition, but not the dazzled condition.

**Success** The creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is blinded for 1 round. The creature can spend an Interact action wiping the salt water from its eyes to end the blinded condition.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
