# Restoration
![[icons-magic-life-heart-cross-strong-green.webp|150]]

Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

*   **Lessen a Toxin** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.
*   **Reduce a Condition** Reduce the value of the target's [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Stupefied 1|Stupefied]] condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** Add [[Drained 1|Drained]] to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's [[Doomed 1|Doomed]] value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent Doomed condition.

**Heightened (6th)** As the 4th-level restoration, but you can reduce a permanent Doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
