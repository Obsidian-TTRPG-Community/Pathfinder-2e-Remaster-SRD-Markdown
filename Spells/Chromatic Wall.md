# Chromatic Wall
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chromatic-wall.webp|150]]

You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.

Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. _Chromatic wall_ can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of _chromatic wall_.

1.  **Red** The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a DC resolve reflex save. _[[Cone of Cold]]_ can counteract a _red chromatic wall_.
2.  **Orange** The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a DC resolve reflex save. _[[Gust of Wind]]_ can counteract an _orange chromatic wall_.
3.  **Yellow** The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a DC resolve reflex save. _[[Disintegrate]]_ can counteract a _yellow chromatic wall_.
4.  **Green** The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute. A DC resolve fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the Enfeebled condition on a success. _[[Magic Passage]]_ can counteract a _green chromatic wall_.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll green wall deals an extra 10 damage.

5.  **Blue** The wall stops auditory, petrification, sonic and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of _[[Petrify]]_. _[[Force Barrage]]_ can counteract a _blue chromatic wall_.
6.  **Indigo** The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of _[[Warp Mind]]_. _[[Holy Light]]_ can counteract an _indigo chromatic wall_.
7.  **Violet** The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a DC resolve will save or they are [[Slowed 1]] for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of _[[Interplanar Teleport]]_. _[[Dispel Magic]]_ can counteract a _violet chromatic wall_.
8.  **Reroll**, and creatures that pass through the wall take a -2 circumstance penalty to their saves.
