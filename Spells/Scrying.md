# Scrying
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-scrying.webp|150]]

You magically spy on a creature of your choice. _Scrying_ works like _[[Clairvoyance]]_, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for _teleport_ and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, _scrying_'s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.

The effect of _scrying_ depends on the target's Will save.

**Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.

**Failure** The spell succeeds.

**Critical Failure** The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
