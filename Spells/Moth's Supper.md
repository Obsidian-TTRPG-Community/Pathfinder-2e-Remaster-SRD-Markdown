# Moth's Supper
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-moths-supper.webp|150]]

You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black-winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance- fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.

*   You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.
*   The first time during the duration when someone successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an additional 4d4 Hit Points.
*   You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of Hit Points healed every 10 minutes increases by 1d4 and the amount of Hit Points regained from the first [[Treat Wounds]] increases by 2d4.
