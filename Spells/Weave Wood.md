# Weave Wood
![[icons-containers-misc-basket-simple-yellow.webp|150]]

With a touch, you cause the target to break into fibrous strands that then weave themselves into a woven mundane object of the same Bulk or less, such as a basket, hat, shield, or mat. You can create up to 4 objects with one casting of this spell, providing their total Bulk doesn't exceed the Bulk of your target. The objects have Hardness 2 and 8 Hit Points.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the maximum Bulk that you can target by 1 and the maximum number of objects you can create by 2.
