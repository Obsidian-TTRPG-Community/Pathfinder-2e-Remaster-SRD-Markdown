# Boil Blood
![[icons-skills-wounds-blood-cells-red.webp|150]]

You heat a foe's blood and boil it within its veins. The target takes 10d10 fire damage, with a Fortitude save. A nonliving creature with blood in its body (such as a vampire) can be affected, but a creature with no blood is immune.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Drained 1|Drained 2]].

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [[Drained 1|Drained 3]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
