# Planar Servitor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-planar-ally.webp|150]]

You call upon a deity (or other divine power) to grant you aid in the form of a divine servitor of your deity's choice, with a level no greater than double the ritual's spell rank. The secondary casters explain what sort of assistance you need and why you need it; if the task is incredibly fitting to the deity, the GM can grant a circumstance bonus to the secondary Diplomacy check or rule that the check is automatically a critical success. If you use the ritual without good reason, the result is automatically a critical failure.

If the ritual succeeds, you must offer the servitor payment depending on factors such as the duration and danger of the task. Payment always costs at least as much as a consumable item of the creature's level, and often costs as much as a permanent magic item of the creature's level to persuade a creature to fight alongside you. Your offerings should align with the personal tastes of the deity.

You can alternatively name a being native to the deity's realm that you know personally, with the same level restriction. Such a creature might request something they personally want as payment.

* * *

**Critical Success** The deity sends a servitor, and the servitor's payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for a particular servitor by name, the deity is likely to send that servitor unless the servitor is busy.

**Success** Your deity sends a servitor.

**Failure** Your deity does not send a servitor.

**Critical Failure** The deity is offended and sends a sign of displeasure or possibly even a servitor to scold or attack you, depending on your deity's nature. A deity might also opt to strip divine powers from its followers who participated until they atone
