# Claim Undead
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-claim-undead.webp|150]]

You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Controlled]] by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if yo give it a new order that is against its nature.
