# Brine Dragon Bile
![[icons-magic-acid-projectile-flame-smoke-green.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within range takes damage from a slashing or piercing attack, or one that inflicts persistent bleed damage.

* * *

You spit a glob of caustic saltwater that stings the wounds of the creature. Make a ranged spell attack against the triggering creature's AC. On a hit, salt scours its open wound, dealing 2d6 persistent acid damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6.
