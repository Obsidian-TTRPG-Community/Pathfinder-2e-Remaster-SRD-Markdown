# Imaginary Weapon
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-imaginary-weapon.webp|150]]

You create a simple weapon of force. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal 2d8 bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice). On a critical success, you deal double damage and can choose to detonate your weapon to push the target 10 feet away from you.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.

* * *

**Amp** You form multiple force weapons to lash out at multiple foes. You make two imaginary weapon Strikes, each against a different target. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made both Strikes.

**Amp Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8 instead of 1d8.
