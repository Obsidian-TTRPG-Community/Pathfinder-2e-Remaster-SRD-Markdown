# Juvenile Companion
![[icons-creatures-mammals-dog-husky-white-blue.webp|150]]

You transform your companion into its juvenile form, such as a cub, foal, kitten, puppy, or piglet, making the target appear harmless. It becomes Tiny (if it was larger), and its reach is reduced to 0 feet. All of its Speeds are halved (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet), and it gains weakness 5 to physical damage. In all other ways, its abilities and statistics are unchanged.

If your companion uses a hostile action, _juvenile companion_ ends. This spell has no effect on a companion that doesn't have a juvenile form.
