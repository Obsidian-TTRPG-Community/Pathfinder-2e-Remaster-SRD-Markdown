# Ymeri's Mark
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ymeris-mark.webp|150]]

You place the fiery mark of the Queen of the Inferno on the target, burning into the creature's very essence. The mark gives off a heat that only you can sense; as long as you're on the same plane as the target, you can sense the direction it's in. The target is [[Fatigued]] and can't reduce the value of this condition normally.

You can detonate the mark at any point during its duration by Dismissing the spell. The rune explodes in a 10 foot emanation centered on the target that deals 5d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. You choose whether the mark's target is included in the explosion.

When you cast the spell, the target attempts a Fortitude save to determine how long the mark lasts. If the spell's duration elapses, the rune doesn't detonate.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The duration is 1 minute.

**Failure** The duration is 1 week.

**Critical Failure** The duration is unlimited.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
