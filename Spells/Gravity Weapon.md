![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-gravity-weapon.webp|150]]

You build up gravitational force and funnel it into your blows, leading to more powerful attacks with blade and bow alike. On your first weapon Strike each round, you gain a status bonus to damage equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice.
