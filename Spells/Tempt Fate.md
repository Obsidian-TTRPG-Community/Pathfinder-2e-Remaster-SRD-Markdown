# Tempt Fate
![[icons-commodities-currency-coin-inset-lightning-green.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.

* * *

You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure.

If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, _tempt fate_ fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.

* * *

**Heightened (8th)** The bonus on the saving throw is +2.
