# Create Skinstitch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-create-skinstitch.webp|150]]

You transform the target into a skinstitch, a hideous construct covered in the flesh of sentient humanoids.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target becomes a skinstitch. If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion which gives it the minion trait. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command that it pursues single-mindedly. If you aren't a follower of [[Norgorber]], it ignores any of your subsequent commands. A follower of Norgorber can give the skinstitch simple commands by presenting a [[Religious Symbol (Silver)|Religious Symbol]] of the deity and commanding it with a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.

**Success** As critical success, except a skinstitch that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks or tries to move it, rather than following your command.

**Failure** You fail to create the skinstitch.

**Critical Failure** You create the skinstitch, but it goes berserk and attempts to kill you, ignoring your commands even if you are a follower of Norgorber.
