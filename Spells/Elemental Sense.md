# Elemental Sense
![[icons-magic-perception-eye-ringed-glow-angry-small-teal.webp|150]]

The elements grant you sensory enhancements. Choose one of the options below. The spell gains the listed trait or traits.

*   **Aquatic Echolocation** (water) You use your hearing as a precise sense when underwater.
*   **Heatsense** (fire) You can sense creatures with a temperature of 90º Fahrenheit or higher within 30 feet as an imprecise sense.
*   **Magnetoreception** (metal) You can sense creatures carrying metal items with a total of 1 Bulk or greater; this is an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. If a creature is made of metal or has the metal trait, you can detect it as though magnetoreception were a precise sense. In addition, you continuously know which direction is north.
*   **Mechanoreception** (air) You can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects. They appear to you as translucent shapes, and they are [[Concealed]] to you.
*   **Tremorsense**(earth) You gain tremorsense (imprecise) with a range of 30 feet.
*   **Woodsense**(plant, wood) You can sense creatures carrying wood items with a total of 1 Bulk or greater; this is an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. If a creature is made of wood or has the plant or wood trait, you can detect it as though woodsense were a precise sense.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** The duration increases to 8 hours, and you can take 1 minute to recalibrate the sense, switching from your current elemental sense to a different one.
