# Jealous Hex
![[icons-magic-control-voodoo-doll-pain-damage-yellow.webp|150]]

You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength ([[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]]); Dexterity ([[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]]); Constitution ([[Drained 1|Drained]]); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ([[Stupefied 1|Stupefied]]). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The condition's value is 1.

**Critical Failure** The condition's value is 2.
