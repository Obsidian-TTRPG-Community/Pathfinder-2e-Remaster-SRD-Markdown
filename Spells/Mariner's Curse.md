# Mariner's Curse
![[icons-magic-water-wave-water-blue.webp|150]]

You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes [[Sickened 1]]. Reducing its sickened condition to 0 ends the curse.

**Failure** The target becomes sickened 1 and can't reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by 4th-rank _[[Cleanse Affliction]]_ or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [[Slowed 1]].

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].
