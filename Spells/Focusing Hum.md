# Focusing Hum
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-focusing-hum.webp|150]]

You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to Cast a Spell while stupefied for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [[Confused]] creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a -2 penalty to Stealth checks to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]].
