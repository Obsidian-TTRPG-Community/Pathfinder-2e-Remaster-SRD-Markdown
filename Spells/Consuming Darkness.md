# Consuming Darkness
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-consuming-darkness.webp|150]]

Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you [[Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], the radius increases by 5 feet. Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes 2d6 void damage and must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.

**Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage and a 10-foot circumstance penalty.

**Critical Failure** The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is [[Immobilized]] for 1 round or until it [[Escape|Escapes]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 void.
