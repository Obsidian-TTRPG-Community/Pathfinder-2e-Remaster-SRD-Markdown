# Rust Cloud
![[icons-magic-air-fog-gas-smoke-orange.webp|150]]

Red-blown flecks of rust jitter in the air, forming a cloud of agitated particles. All creatures within the cloud become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. The cloud deals 5d10 slashing damage to any creature that starts its turn in the area, with a basic Fortitude save.

Metal that rusts off of a creature adds to the cloud. When a metal creature takes damage from the cloud, the cloud's area increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of a 40 foot burst), and the creature starts to rust, taking 1d4 persistent,slashing damage. You can Dismiss the cloud.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The cloud's slashing damage increases by 1d10 and the persistent damage increases by 1d4.
