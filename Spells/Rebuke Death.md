# Rebuke Death
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-rebuke-death.webp|150]]

You snatch creatures from the jaws of death, restoring them without the straing of a typical close call. You can spend 1 to 3 actions Casting this Spell, and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains 3d6 Hit Points. If the target had the [[Dying 1|Dying]] condition, coming back from Dying due to this healing doesn't increase its [[Wounded 1|Wounded]] condition.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the healing by 1d6.
