# Battlefield Persistence

**Trigger** You are about to attempt a saving throw, but you haven't rolled yet.

You're difficult to remove from battle. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save, and if the triggering save is against an incapacitation effect, it treats you as if you were 2 levels higher.
