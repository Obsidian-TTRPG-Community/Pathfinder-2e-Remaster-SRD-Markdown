# Unbreaking Wave Advance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-unbreaking-wave-advance.webp|150]]

You unleash a mighty wave from your hand that buffets back your foes. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave advance_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 3d6 damage.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet.

**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage for pushing a creature into a solid barrier increases by 1d6.
