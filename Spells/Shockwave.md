# Shockwave
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shockwave.webp|150]]

You create a wave of energy that ripples through the earth. Terrestrial creatures in the affected area must attempt a Reflex save to avoid stumbling as the shockwave shakes the ground.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn.

**Failure** The creature falls [[Prone]].

**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature takes 1d6 damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The area increases by 5 feet (to a 20-foot cone at 2nd level, and so on).
