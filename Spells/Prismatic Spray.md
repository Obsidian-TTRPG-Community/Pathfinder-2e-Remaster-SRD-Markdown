# Prismatic Spray
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-prismatic-spray.webp|150]]

A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature.
