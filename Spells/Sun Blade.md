# Sun Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-sunblade.webp|150]]

You fire a ray of burning sunlight from your weapon. You must be wielding a sword or spear to cast _sun blade_, and you perform this spell's somatic component with the weapon. Make a spell attack roll. The ray deals 1d4 fire damage. If the target is evil, the ray deals an additional 1d4 spirit damage, and if the target is undead, the ray deals an additional 1d4 vitality damage (both effects apply against creatures that are both evil and undead). If you are in an area of bright natural sunlight, increase the die size of each damage die by one step (from d4 to d6).

**Critical Success** The ray deals double damage.
