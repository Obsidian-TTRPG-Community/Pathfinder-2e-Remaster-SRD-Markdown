# Incendiary Aura
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-incendiary-aura.webp|150]]

You surround yourself with a combustible aura. Each time a creature within the emanation takes fire damage, it catches on fire, taking 2d4 persistent fire damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the persistent damage by 1d4 and the radius of the emanation by 5 feet.
