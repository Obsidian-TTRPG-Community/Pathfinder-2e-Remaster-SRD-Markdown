# Chromatic Ray
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chromatic-ray.webp|150]]

You send out a ray of colored light streaming toward your enemy, with a magical effect depending on the ray's color. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, roll 1d4 to see which beam you cast. If the ray deals damage, that damage is doubled on a critical hit. Any additional traits that apply to a ray are listed in parentheses just after the name of the color.

1.  **Red** (fire) The ray deals 30 fire damage to the target.
2.  **Orange** (acid) The ray deals 40 acid damage to the target.
3.  **Yellow** (electricity) The ray deals 50 electricity damage to the target.
4.  **Green** (poison) The ray deals 25 poison damage to the target, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute ([[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] on a critical failure).

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** The damage for 40 fire{Red}, 50 acid{Orange}, 60 electricity{Yellow}, and 35 poison{Green} each increase by 10. Roll 1d8 to determine the ray's color, using the results for 1-4 above and the results for 5-8 below.

5.  **Blue** The ray has the effect of the _[[Petrify]]_ spell. On a critical hit, the target is [[Clumsy 1]] as long as it's [[Slowed 1|Slowed]] by the _flesh to stone_ effect.
6.  **Indigo** (emotion, incapacitation, mental) The ray has the effect of the _[[Confusion]]_ spell. On a critical hit, it has the effect of _[[Warp Mind]]_ instead.
7.  **Violet** The target is [[Slowed 1|Slowed]] for 1 minute. It must also succeed at a will save or be teleported 120 feet directly away from you (if there isn't room for it to appear there, it appears in the nearest open space); this is a teleportation effect.
8.  **Intense Color** The target is [[Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn, or [[Blinded]] if your attack roll was a critical hit. Roll again and add the effects of another color (rerolling results of 8).
