# Wall Of Mirrors
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-maze-of-locked-doors.webp|150]]

You create a solid wall of shimmering reflective glass up to 50 feet long and 20 feet high. The wall is an inch thick and stands vertically. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Everything on each side of the wall is [[Concealed]] from creatures on the opposite side. If a creature Strikes the wall, the wall causes the creature to endure the mental anguish of that attack's pain as well; the creature takes 4d4 mental damage and can resist this damage with a basic Will save.

**Heightened (+1)** The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 10.
