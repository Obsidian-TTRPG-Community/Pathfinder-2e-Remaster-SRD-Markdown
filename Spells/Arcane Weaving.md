# Arcane Weaving
![[icons-sundries-documents-document-torn-diagram-tan.webp|150]]

You and the secondary casters weave together spells (and, if anadis, silk) in a complex ritual that combines magical learning with art, allowing all the participants to share spells they know with one another.

* * *

**Success** You or any secondary caster can swap any spell in your spell repertoire for a spell in the spell repertoire of any other participant. This spell can't be a higher level than the ritual's level.

**Failure** None of the participants can swap spells.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and all participants are [[Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours and can't reduce their stupefied condition below 1 for 24 hours.
