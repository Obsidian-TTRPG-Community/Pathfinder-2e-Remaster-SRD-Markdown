# Phantasmal Calamity
![[icons-magic-earth-explosion-lava-stone-red.webp|150]]

A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each creature in the area. The vision deals 11d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or believe it's trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails the second save, it's also [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] for 1 minute. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the illusion and recovers from the Stunned condition.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
