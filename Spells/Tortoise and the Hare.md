# Tortoise and the Hare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tortoise-and-the-hare.webp|150]]

You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The targets are unaffected.

**Success** The foe is [[Slowed 1]] for 1 round, and the other target is unaffected.

**Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 rounds and the other target is [[Quickened]] for 1 round. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.

**Critical Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 minutes and the other target is quickened for 1 minute. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
