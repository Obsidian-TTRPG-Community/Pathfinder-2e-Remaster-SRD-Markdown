# Suspended Retribution
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-suspended-retribution.webp|150]]

All life dances one step from the precipice, one heartbeat from disaster. You open your eyes wide and see doom waiting in the wings, then invite it to step forward. A spectral omen of disaster appears above the target's head- traditionally, this is a downward-pointing sword, but some spellcasters report seeing a hangman's noose or a grinning skull instead. When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the following triggers.

*   The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.
*   The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.
*   The target Casts a Spell.
*   The target uses a specific skill you name.
*   The target uses a specific ability you name.

If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of doom activates-the sword strikes down, the noose loops around the target's neck, the skull bares its fangs-and the target takes 70 mental damage with a basic Reflex save. The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10.
