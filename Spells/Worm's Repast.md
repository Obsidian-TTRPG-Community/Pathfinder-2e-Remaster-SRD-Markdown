# Worm's Repast
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-worms-repast.webp|150]]

Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the target creature, dealing 4d6 piercing damage and 1d6 persistent piercing damage. If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra 2d6 persistent piercing damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.

**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.

**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage and is [[Off-Guard]] due to the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also [[Slowed 1]] by the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The initial and persistent damage increase by 2d6 and 1d6, respectively
