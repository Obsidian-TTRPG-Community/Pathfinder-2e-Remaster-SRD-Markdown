# Blackfinger's Blades
![[icons-skills-melee-blade-tip-damaged-acid-green.webp|150]]

You pray for swift and painful death to your enemies and find your and your allies' weapons blessed to deliver just that.

The target weapons are coated with [[Giant Scorpion Venom]] with a DC equal to your spell DC.

The effects remain on a weapon for 1 minute or until the weapon deals damage, whichever comes first.
