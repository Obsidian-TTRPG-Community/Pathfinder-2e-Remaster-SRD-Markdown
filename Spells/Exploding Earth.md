# Exploding Earth
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-exploding-earth.webp|150]]

You throw a hard-packed ball of earth and stone at a creature, and the projectile explodes upon impact. Attempt a spell attack against the target's AC. If you hit, you deal 4d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 bludgeoning splash damage. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the splash damage, and the target you hit must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or fall [[Prone]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 2d6, and the splash damage increases by 1d6.
