# Divine Plagues
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-divine-plagues.webp|150]]

Your deity sends wracking plagues. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. When you Cast the Spell, decide whether the disease inflicts the Clumsy, Enfeebled, or Stupefied condition.

**Divine Plague** (disease) **Level** 1

**Stage 1** [[Clumsy 1]], [[Enfeebled 1]], or [[Stupefied 1]] (1 round)

**Stage 2** [[Slowed 1]], and Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 (1 round)

**Stage 3** Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 and the target can't recover from the condition until they are cured (1 day)

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 1.

**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 2.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** The divine plague disease gains the virulent trait. The condition value for the Clumsy, Enfeebled, or Stupefied condition is 2 instead of 1.
