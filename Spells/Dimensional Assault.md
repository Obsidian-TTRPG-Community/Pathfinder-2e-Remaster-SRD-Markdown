# Dimensional Assault
![[icons-magic-movement-trail-streak-impact-blue.webp|150]]

You tumble through space, making a short dimensional hop to better position yourself for an attack. Teleport to any square in range that's within reach of a creature, and then make a melee Strike against one creature within your reach.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
