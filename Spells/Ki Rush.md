# Ki Rush
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ki-rush.webp|150]]

Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order).

You gain the [[Concealed]] condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn.
