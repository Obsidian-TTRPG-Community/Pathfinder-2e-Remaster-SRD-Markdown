# Ki Cutting Sight
![[icons-magic-perception-third-eye-blue-red.webp|150]]

Ki flows through everything in existence—animals and plants, living and dead, mortals and spirits. Strike at just the right place, in just the right way, and the flow is stopped, with dire consequences.

When you Cast the Spell, make a perception check against the target's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the next time you deal damage to the target with a Strike or ki spell, you deal 4d10 additional slashing damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The precision damage increases by 1d10.
