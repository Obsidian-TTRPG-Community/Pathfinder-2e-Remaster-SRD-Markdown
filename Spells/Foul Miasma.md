# Foul Miasma
![[icons-magic-acid-dissolve-bone-ribs-skull.webp|150]]

You multiply the disease within a creature, drawing it into an infectious mist outside their body where it can spread to other creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spell's duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target.
