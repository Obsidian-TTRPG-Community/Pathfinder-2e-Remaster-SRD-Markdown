# Mask of Terror
![[icons-commodities-treasure-mask-wood-tan.webp|150]]

The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Frightened 1|Frightened 2]] before using its action.

**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Frightened 1|Frightened 2]], and its action fails and is wasted.

* * *

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against _mask of terror_.
