# Cauterize Wounds
![[icons-magic-fire-projectile-smoke-swirl-red.webp|150]]

You seal bleeding wounds with fire. Any target that has persistent bleed damage can choose to take 1 fire damage. If it does, it can attempt to recover from its persistent bleed damage, with the lower DC for particularly effective assistance. During the spell's duration, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to repeat this effect for one target of the spell.
