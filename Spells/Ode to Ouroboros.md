# Ode to Ouroboros
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ode-to-ouroboros.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature's dying condition would reach the value at which they would die.

* * *

Your ode staves off death. The target's dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as [[Disintegrate]] and death effects.
