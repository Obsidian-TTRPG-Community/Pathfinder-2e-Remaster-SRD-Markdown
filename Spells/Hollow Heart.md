# Hollow Heart
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-hollow-heart.webp|150]]

You stoke the target's ambition beyond reason, until it believes no one is capable of helping it, or that others aren't to be trusted. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target treats no other creature as an ally for 1 round.

**Failure** The target treats no other creature as an ally for 3 rounds.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is [[Frightened 1]] as it realizes it can't rely on anyone but itself.
