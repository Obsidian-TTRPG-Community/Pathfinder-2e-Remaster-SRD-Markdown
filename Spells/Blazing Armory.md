# Blazing Armory
![[icons-magic-fire-dagger-rune-enchant-flame-strong-red.webp|150]]

As long as you have magic, you're never unarmed. You materialize a flaming simulacrum of any common simple or martial weapon into the target's grasp. The target must have a free hand to hold the weapon, or else the weapon falls to the ground in the target's space. The blazing weapon functions as a _+1 striking weapon_, and its damage type changes to fire. The damage type can't be changed using the versatile trait, modular trait, or similar methods.

A thrown weapon rematerializes in the target's hand after the Strike is complete. If you choose a ranged weapon that uses ammunition, the wielder must still reload the weapon using the normal number of actions, though this generates ammunition automatically; this functions as normal ammunition, and the blazing weapon can't use other types of ammunition.

Any creature other than you or the target that attempts to touch, make a Strike with, or [[Disarm]] the weapon takes 1d6 fire damage each time.
