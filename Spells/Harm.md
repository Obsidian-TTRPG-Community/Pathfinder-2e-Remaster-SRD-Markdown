# Harm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-harm.webp|150]]

You channel void energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 void damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

1 The spell has a range of touch.

2 **(concentrate)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

3 **(concentrate)** You disperse void energy in a 30 foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
