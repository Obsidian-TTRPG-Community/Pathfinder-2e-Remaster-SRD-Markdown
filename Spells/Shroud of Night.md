# Shroud of Night
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shroud-of-night.webp|150]]

Your patron blankets the target's eyes in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. It treats bright light as dim light, and unless it has greater darkvision, all creatures are [[Concealed]] to it.
